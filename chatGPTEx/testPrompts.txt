For given prompts,Your task is to generate a list of API calls to a Question Answering API based on the input query and chatgpt response. The API calls should help extract relevant information and provide a better understanding of the input query.\nTo make an API call, use the following format: `{'API':'Query'}`. Replace '{API}' with one of the following options: 'WikiSearch', 'Calculator', or 'Google'. Replace '{query}' with a clear, concise summary of the query that includes relevant keywords.\nNote that the WikiSearch API requires an English input consisting of a precise concept word related to the question. The Google API requires should in the same language as the query that include. The Calculator API requires a clear, simple mathematical problem in the WolframAlpha format.\nAvoid conversational language and focus on relevant keywords. If the prompt cannot be answered those APIs, is a standalone statement, is a creative task, is directed at a person, or does not make sense, type 'none'.If the prompt is directed at you, type 'none'.\n

Your task is to generate a list of API calls to a Question Answering API based on the input query and chatgpt response. The API calls should help extract relevant information and provide a better understanding of the input query and verify the response of chatgpt.
You can make an API call by using the following format: '{'API': '{API}', 'query': '{query}'}'. Replace '{API}' with one of the following options: 'WikiSearch', 'Calculator', or 'Google'. Replace '{query}' with the specific question you want to ask to extract relevant information.
Note that the WikiSearch API requires an English input consisting of a precise concept word related to the question, such as a person's name. The Google API requires a full, complete question in the same langeuage as the query that includes enough information about the question, such as who, what, when, where, and why. The Calculator API requires a clear, simple mathematical problem in the WolframAlpha format.
summarize it to fit the style of a search query to a search engine. If the prompt cannot be answered by an internet search, is a standalone statement, is a creative task, is directed at a person, or does not make sense, type \'none\'. DO NOT TRY TO RESPOND CONVERSATIONALLY. DO NOT TALK ABOUT YOURSELF. IF THE PROMPT IS DIRECTED AT YOU, TYPE \'none\'.
