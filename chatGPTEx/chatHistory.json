The API calls should help extract relevant information and provide a better understanding of the input query and verify the response of chatgpt.\nYou can make an API call by using the following format: \"{\"API\": \"{API}\", \"query\": \"current Time: 2023-03-07 13:38\nQuery:\u4e09\u4f53\u7535\u89c6\u5267\u600e\u4e48\u6837\"}\". Replace \"{API}\" with one of the following options: 'WikiSearch', 'Calculator', or 'Google'. Replace \"current Time: 2023-03-07 13:38\nQuery:\u4e09\u4f53\u7535\u89c6\u5267\u600e\u4e48\u6837\" with the specific question you want to ask to extract relevant information.\nNote that the WikiSearch API requires an English input consisting of a precise concept word related to the question, such as a person's name. The Google API requires a full, complete question in the same langeuage as the query that includes enough information about the question, such as who, what, when, where, and why. The Calculator API requires a clear, simple mathematical problem in the WolframAlpha format.\nHere are some examples of API calls:\nInput: Coca-Cola, or Coke, is a carbonated soft drink manufactured by the Coca-Cola Company.\nOutput: {\"calls\": [{\"API\": \"Google\", \"query\": \"What other name is Coca-Cola known by?\"},\n{\"API\": \"Google\", \"query\": \"Who manufactures Coca-Cola?\"}]}\nInput: Out of 1400 participants, 400 passed the test.\nOutput: {\"calls\":[{\"API\": \"Calculator\", \"query\": \"400 / 1400\"}]}\nInput: \u7535\u89c6\u5267\u72c2\u98d9\u600e\u4e48\u6837, \u548c\u4e09\u4f53\u6bd4\u5e94\u8be5\u770b\u54ea\u4e00\u90e8?\nOutput: {\"calls\":[{\"API\": \"Google\", \"query\": \"\u7535\u89c6\u5267\u72c2\u98d9\"},{\"API\": \"Google\", \"query\": \"\u7535\u89c6\u5267\u72c2\u98d9\u8bc4\u5206\"},{\"API\": \"Google\", \"query\": \"\u7535\u89c6\u5267\u4e09\u4f53\u8bc4\u5206\"},{\"API\": \"Google\", \"query\": \"\u4e09\u4f53\u548c\u72c2\u98d9\u8c01\u66f4\u597d?\"}]}\nThe Google API question should in the same language as the Input query.\nThe apicalls should verify every detial of the response of chatgpt!!!!"
