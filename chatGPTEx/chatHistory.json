Here's a basic implementation of quick sort in Python:\n\n```\ndef quick_sort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    else:\n        pivot = arr[0]\n        less = [x for x in arr[1:] if x <= pivot]\n        greater = [x for x in arr[1:] if x > pivot]\n        return quick_sort(less) + [pivot] + quick_sort(greater)\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we first check if the length of the array is less than or equal to 1. If so, we just return the array as it is already sorted. Otherwise, we select the first element of the array as the pivot and create two sub-arrays: one containing elements less than or equal to the pivot and another containing elements greater than the pivot. We then recursively apply quick sort to both sub-arrays and concatenate the sorted sub-arrays with the pivot element in between to get the final sorted array.\n\nI hope that helps!
